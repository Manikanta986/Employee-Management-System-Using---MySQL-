# 💼 Employee Management System using MySQL

This project is a complete **Employee Management System (EMS)** built using **MySQL**. It aims to efficiently manage employee details, job roles, departments, payroll, and leave records through a relational database system.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Organizations often struggle with fragmented employee data and manual processing of salary, department assignments, and leave records.  
This project solves these challenges by designing a **centralized relational database** for managing all HR operations.

---

## 🥅 Project Objectives  
- Design a normalized relational database for HR data management.  
- Maintain relationships between employees, departments, and salaries.  
- Automate payroll processing with leave deductions.  
- Generate HR insights using SQL joins, subqueries, and CTEs.  
- Enforce data integrity using primary and foreign key constraints.

## 🧱 Database Structure  

### 📂 All datasets are available inside the folder for easy access.

- <a href = "https://github.com/Manikanta986/Employee-Management-System-Using---MySQL-/tree/main/Employee_Management_system_datasets" >Datasets</a>

### **Tables Created**

1. **JobDepartment** – Stores job roles, departments, and salary ranges.  
2. **SalaryBonus** – Contains salary, bonus, and annual pay linked to job roles.  
3. **Employee** – Stores employee personal and contact details.  
4. **Qualification** – Tracks employee qualifications and skill requirements.  
5. **Leaves** – Records employee leave history with reasons and dates.  
6. **Payroll** – Combines employee, job, salary, and leave data for net payment calculation.

### **Constraints Used**
- Primary Keys  
- Foreign Keys (with `CASCADE` and `SET NULL`)  
- Unique Constraints on `emp_email`  
- Cascading Delete/Update Actions  

### **SQL Concepts Applied**
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Subqueries and CTEs  
- Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)  
- GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses  
- Window Functions for ranking and insights

I’ve also designed an **ER Diagram** to visualize the database structure.

## 📊 Insights & Observations  
- The **Sales** department has the highest total salary allocation.  
- The **IT** department provides the highest average salary.  
- Over **20% of employees** exceed their allowed leave limit.  
- Some employees hold **multiple qualifications**, increasing role eligibility.  
- The **total annual salary expenditure** can be derived through query-based reports.

## 💡 Conclusion  
The **Employee Management System** improves HR efficiency, ensures payroll accuracy, and provides data-driven insights for better decision-making.  
It demonstrates practical knowledge of **database normalization, foreign key constraints, joins, and advanced SQL queries**.
